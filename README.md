# Random-Walk-Simulation

This repository explores the **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** through the lens of random walks. Over the fall, I conducted a three-part seminar on the Central Limit Theorem. As part of the second session, I proved the **Laplace-De Moivre Theorem**, which establishes the CLT in the context of Bernoulli random variables. These variables can be interpreted as steps in a random walk.

To enhance intuition about the theorem, I created three pieces of code that demonstrate key concepts of random walks and their convergence properties.

### **1. The Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**

The CLT is one of the foundational results in probability theory. It states that the sum (or average) of a large number of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables, when properly normalized, tends toward a normal distribution, regardless of the original distribution of the variables.

### **2. Laplace-De Moivre Theorem**

The Laplace-De Moivre Theorem is a specific case of the CLT. It proves that the distribution of sums of Bernoulli random variables approaches a normal distribution as the number of trials increases. This can be interpreted as the behavior of a random walk converging to a Gaussian distribution.
