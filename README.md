# Random-Walk-Simulation

This repository explores the **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** through the lens of random walks. Over the fall, I conducted a three-part seminar on the Central Limit Theorem In university of Tehran. As part of the second session, I proved the **Laplace-De Moivre Theorem**, which establishes the CLT in the context of Bernoulli random variables. These variables can be interpreted as steps in a random walk.

To enhance intuition about the theorem, this repository includes three scripts demonstrating different aspects of random walks and their connection to the CLT.

## **Files and Functionality**

### 1. **`Random Walk Simulation.py`**  
   This script simulates a simple random walk and visualizes its trajectory.  
   - Observe the movement of a random walk over time.
   - Useful for understanding how random walks behave step-by-step.

### 2. **`heatmap.py`**  
   This script generates a heatmap of outcomes from several random walk realizations.  
   - Simulates multiple random walks and aggregates their results.
   - Provides a visual representation of the distribution of endpoints and paths.

### 3. **`approximation.py`**  
   This script approximates the distribution of the random walk.  
   - Normalizes the results and overlays the theoretical Gaussian distribution.
   - Demonstrates how the random walk's distribution converges to a normal curve, as predicted by the Central Limit Theorem.
